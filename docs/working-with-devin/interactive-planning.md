# Interactive Planning with Devin

Interactive planning allows you to collaborate with Devin to design, review, and refine your infrastructure changes before implementation. This approach reduces errors, improves outcomes, and ensures alignment with your requirements.

## ðŸŽ¯ Planning Methodology

### Collaborative Infrastructure Design
Work with Devin to plan infrastructure changes through structured conversations:

```
Phase 1: Requirements Gathering
- Define the business or technical need
- Identify constraints and dependencies
- Establish success criteria
- Consider security and compliance requirements

Phase 2: Architecture Planning
- Design the solution approach
- Identify affected components
- Plan implementation sequence
- Consider rollback strategies

Phase 3: Implementation Planning
- Break down into manageable tasks
- Identify testing and validation steps
- Plan deployment approach
- Document the plan
```

### Example: Planning a Load Balancer Implementation

#### Initial Planning Request
```
I need to add load balancing to our current OpenStack web servers (web1 and web2). 
Let's plan this together.

Current Infrastructure:
- 2 web servers running Apache2
- Security group allowing HTTP/HTTPS
- Private network configuration
- No current load balancing

Requirements:
- Distribute traffic between web1 and web2
- Health checks for server availability
- SSL termination at load balancer
- Minimal downtime during implementation

Let's start by discussing the architecture approach.
```

#### Devin's Planning Response
```
Great! Let's plan this load balancer implementation step by step.

Architecture Options:
1. OpenStack LBaaS v2 (Octavia) - Native OpenStack solution
2. HAProxy on dedicated instance - More control, manual management
3. Nginx load balancer - Lightweight, good for HTTP/HTTPS

Recommendation: OpenStack LBaaS v2 for better integration

Proposed Architecture:
Internet â†’ Load Balancer â†’ [web1, web2]

Implementation Plan:
1. Create load balancer resource in Terraform
2. Configure listener for HTTP/HTTPS
3. Create pool with web1 and web2 as members
4. Set up health monitors
5. Update security groups
6. Test and validate

Questions for you:
- Do you prefer LBaaS v2 or would you like to explore other options?
- Any specific health check requirements?
- SSL certificate management preferences?
```

### Application Level
- Apache2 service status
- HTTP response times
- Error rates
- Connection counts

### System Level
- CPU, memory, disk usage
- Network I/O
- Process monitoring
- Log analysis

## Implementation Strategy
### Monitoring Stack
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- AlertManager for notifications
- Node Exporter for system metrics

### Deployment Approach
1. Create monitoring server with Terraform
2. Install and configure Prometheus
3. Deploy node exporters to web servers
4. Configure Grafana dashboards
5. Set up alerting rules
6. Test end-to-end monitoring

## Planning Questions
- What are your critical alert thresholds?
- Preferred notification channels (email, Slack, PagerDuty)?
- Data retention requirements?
- Dashboard access and permissions?
```

## ðŸš€ Interactive Planning Workflows

### Iterative Refinement Process
```
1. Initial Proposal
   - Devin presents initial plan
   - Highlights key decisions needed
   - Identifies potential issues

2. Collaborative Review
   - Discuss alternatives
   - Refine requirements
   - Address concerns
   - Validate assumptions

3. Plan Finalization
   - Document final approach
   - Confirm implementation steps
   - Establish validation criteria
   - Set success metrics

4. Implementation Readiness
   - All questions resolved
   - Clear action items
   - Risk mitigation planned
   - Rollback strategy defined
```

### Example: Security Hardening Planning Session

#### Planning Conversation
```
User: "I want to improve the security of our web servers. Let's plan this together."

Devin: "Excellent! Let's approach this systematically. 

Current Security Assessment:
- SSH access on default port 22
- Password authentication likely enabled
- Basic firewall rules
- No intrusion detection
- Standard Ubuntu security settings

Security Hardening Areas:
1. SSH Security
   - Change SSH port
   - Disable password auth
   - Implement fail2ban

2. Firewall Enhancement
   - Implement UFW with strict rules
   - Close unnecessary ports
   - Log dropped connections

3. System Hardening
   - Automatic security updates
   - Remove unnecessary packages
   - File permission auditing

4. Monitoring & Detection
   - Log monitoring
   - Intrusion detection
   - Security event alerting

Which areas would you like to prioritize first?"

User: "Let's start with SSH security and firewall. What's your recommended approach?"

Devin: "Great choice! Here's my recommended approach:

SSH Security Plan:
1. Change SSH port to 2222 (or your preferred port)
2. Disable password authentication
3. Install and configure fail2ban
4. Set up SSH key-only access

Implementation Strategy:
- Update Ansible roles for SSH configuration
- Modify security groups in Terraform
- Test SSH access before disabling password auth
- Implement fail2ban with reasonable thresholds

Firewall Plan:
1. Install and configure UFW
2. Default deny all incoming
3. Allow only necessary ports: 80, 443, 2222
4. Enable logging for security monitoring

Questions:
- What SSH port would you prefer?
- Any specific fail2ban configuration requirements?
- Should we implement this on staging first?"
