      - name: Setup Terraform
        uses: hashicorp/setup-terraform@v2
      
      - name: Terraform Plan
        run: |
          terraform init
          terraform plan -out=tfplan

  deploy:
    needs: plan
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    steps:
      - name: Apply Infrastructure
        run: terraform apply tfplan
