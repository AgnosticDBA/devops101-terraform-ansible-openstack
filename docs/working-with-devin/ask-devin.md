### Troubleshooting Questions
When asking for troubleshooting help, provide comprehensive context:

```
Problem Description Template:

Issue: [Brief description of the problem]

Environment:
- OpenStack version: [version]

- Ansible version: [version]
- Operating system: [OS and version]

Current Configuration:
- [Relevant Terraform files]
- [Ansible playbook sections]
- [Environment variables]

Error Messages:
```
[Exact error output]
```

Steps Taken:
1. [What you've already tried]
2. [Results of those attempts]

Expected Behavior:
[What should happen instead]
```

#### Example: Terraform Troubleshooting
```
Issue: Terraform apply fails when creating OpenStack instances

Environment:
- OpenStack Rocky release
- Terraform v1.5.0
- terraform-provider-openstack v1.48.0

Current Configuration:
terraform-instances.tf shows:
resource "openstack_compute_instance_v2" "web1" {
  name            = "web1"
  image_name      = "Ubuntu-18.04-Latest"
  flavor_id       = "0"
  key_pair        = "${openstack_compute_keypair_v2.terraform-key.name}"
  security_groups = ["default", "${openstack_compute_secgroup_v2.sec.name}"]
  
  network {
    name = "${var.unique_network_name}"
  }
}

Error Message:
```
Error: Error creating OpenStack server: Expected HTTP response code [201 202] when accessing [POST https://openstack:8774/v2.1/servers], but got 400 instead
{"badRequest": {"message": "Invalid flavor_id provided.", "code": 400}}
```

Steps Taken:
1. Verified OpenStack credentials are correct
2. Checked that the image exists with `openstack image list`
3. Confirmed network exists with `openstack network list`

Expected Behavior:
Instance should be created successfully with the specified configuration.
```

### Configuration Review Questions
When asking for configuration reviews, provide complete context:

```
Configuration Review Template:

Objective: [What you're trying to achieve]

Current Implementation:
[Paste relevant configuration files]

Specific Concerns:
- [Security considerations]
- [Performance concerns]
- [Maintainability issues]
- [Scalability requirements]

Questions:
1. [Specific question about approach]
2. [Question about best practices]
3. [Question about alternatives]
```

#### Example: Ansible Role Structure Review
```
Objective: Optimize our Ansible playbook structure for better maintainability and reusability

Current Implementation:
playbook.yml contains 87 lines with multiple roles:
- system/docker
- system/boot
- web/apache2
- web/nginx
- database/mysql
- monitoring/metricbeat

Specific Concerns:
- Playbook is becoming unwieldy
- Some roles have overlapping functionality
- Difficult to run specific configurations
- No clear separation between environments

Questions:
1. How should we restructure this for better organization?
2. What's the best practice for role dependencies?
3. Should we split this into multiple playbooks?
4. How do we handle environment-specific configurations?
```

## ðŸš€ Advanced Help Scenarios

### Architecture Design Consultation
```
Scenario: Designing a new monitoring solution

Current Infrastructure:
- 2 web servers (web1, web2) running Apache2
- OpenStack environment with basic networking
- No current monitoring solution

Requirements:
- Monitor system metrics (CPU, memory, disk)
- Track application performance
- Alert on critical issues
- Visualize trends and patterns
- Integrate with existing infrastructure

Questions:
